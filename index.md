    print("The number isn't a palindrome!")
```
## Practical 11
```python
# 11. Write a python program to display ascending and descending order from given 10 numbers.
"""
- The sort() method sorts the list ascending by default.
- reverse Optional. reverse=True will sort the list descending. Default is reverse=False

numbers.sort()
print(numbers)

# Sorting list of Integers in descending.
numbers.sort(reverse=True)

    for j in range(i + 1, len(myarray)):
        if(myarray[i] == myarray[j]):
            print(myarray[j])
```
## Practical 13
```python
# 13.Write Python programs to create functions and use functions in the program.
"""
- A function can be defined as the organized block of reusable code, which can be called whenever required.
- Python provides the def keyword to define the function.

## Practical 14
```python
# 14. Write Python programs to using lambda function.
"""
Python Lambda function is known as the anonymous function that is defined without a name. Python allows us to not declare the function in the standard manner, i.e., by using the def keyword. Rather, the anonymous functions are declared by using the lambda keyword. However, Lambda functions can accept any number of arguments, but they can return only one value in the form of expression.

## Practical 15
```python
# 15. Write Python programs Loading the module in Python code.
"""
A python module can be defined as a python program file which contains a python code including python functions, class, or variables. In other words, we can say that our python code file saved with the extension (.py) is treated as the module. We may have a runnable code inside the python module.

## Practical 17
```python
# 17. Write Python programs to implement a concept of list.
"""
A list in Python is used to store the sequence of various types of data. Python lists are mutable type its mean we can modify its element after it created. However, Python consists of six data-types that are capable to store the sequences, but the most common and reliable type is the list.
A list can be defined as a collection of values or items of different types. The items in the list are separated with the comma (,) and enclosed with the square brackets [].

"""
avengers = ["Ironman", "Spiderman", "Hulk", "Wanda", "Hawkeye", "Natasha"]

## Practical 18
```python
# 18. Write Python programs to implement a concept of tuples.
"""
Python Tuple is used to store the sequence of immutable Python objects. The tuple is similar to lists since the value of the items stored in the list can be changed, whereas the tuple is immutable, and the value of the items stored in the tuple cannot be changed.

Nested List Comprehensions are nothing but a list comprehension within another list comprehension which is quite similar to nested for loops.
